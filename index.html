    	</div><!--I am working on coding the first question with the example provided in the assignment. I want to try changing the type of button as well
		I committed the change to see if it worked, but only the No Button looks right. I am checking my Yes button by adding a carrot and a space.
		It still did not work so I checked with the reference again for any mistakes. I refreshed the website and I realized that it takes a second to catch up.-->

<div class="page" id="two">
	<div id="header" class="w3-container w3-flat-carrot">
		<h1>Question 2</h1>

	<div id="content" class="w3-container">
		<p>Do you have a fever?</p>

		<a href="#three" onclick="allergyAdd();" class="w3-button w3-pink w3-round">No</a>

		<a href="#four" onclick="allergyAdd();" class="w3-button w3-green w3-round">No</a>
	</div><!--I now added the third question and am going to run it to see if my retyping was correct.
I did not work and I realized that I had coded my buttons underneath the page, not under the question.
It still did not work, so I tried adding a </div below it and before the footer.
It is still not going past the second question, so I am looking into question 2's code. I changed the question headers to say <div id>.
I switched the cold and allergy counts to the correct yes or no responses. Then, I think I figured out why it was not going past the 
second page, so I changed the code for "two" for the button to page three. It worked! So I am going to make questions four and five.-->

		<!--Here, I am trying to make the Results button on the bottom of this page.
		It did not work, so I added a seventh page for showing results to see if the button would pop up.
		It added to the very first page, so I am looking for a way to add it to the sixth page. I "tabbed" it to fit right under the buttons above.
		I am still seeing the results button on the first page, so I am adding the w3-container above this button. The seventh results page was successful, though.
		The results button will not leave the intro first page, so I am going to make a separate page with a "click here to see results" button.
		I successfully removed the results button from the first page, but there is no space between the top of the website and the button, so I am going to add some.
		The space worked, but the title seems a bit redundant, so I am going to change it.-->
