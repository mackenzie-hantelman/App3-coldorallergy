Brief Description of Goal of Code:
The goal of this code is to diagnose whether one has a cold or just allergies based on their symptoms. 
 
Known Issues:
There are a limited number of questions to diagnose, and you cannot use the back button to redo the quiz.

							//the total number of 4 questions, and multiplying by 100 for a percentage.//
	var coldPercent = (cold_count)/(4)*100 //The same arithmetic was applied here, but for the cold count//
	var resultText = document.getElementById("results"); //This line replaces the "results" text in the final page with the probabilities calculated//
	resultText.innerHTML = "Probability it is allergies =" + allergyPercent + "<br> Probability it is a cold =" + coldPercent; 
	//The line above actually spells out what is being replaced, including the calculations made by the functions//

  </script>

	<!--Here, I am inserting a function that should display my results (the probability counts) when the results button is pressed//
	Nothing happened here, so I am trying to put it below with the results page//
	It wasn't working, so I am rereading what the assignment says and formatting it in the way the w3school has it on their website. I added both function
	codes within the <script> above.
	I realized I was not calculating the actual percentages, so once I added that, I was able to produce a result, and therefore a page.-->

		I did not work and I realized that I had coded my buttons underneath the page, not under the question.
		It still did not work, so I tried adding a </div below it and before the footer.
		It is still not going past the second question, so I am looking into question 2's code. I changed the question headers to say <div id>.
		I switched the cold and allergy counts to the correct yes or no responses. Then, I think I figured out why it was not going past the 
		second page, so I changed the code for "two" for the button to page three. It worked! So I am going to make questions four and five.-->

		I am still seeing the results button on the first page, so I am adding the w3-container above this button. The seventh results page was successful, though.
		The results button will not leave the intro first page, so I am going to make a separate page with a "click here to see results" button.
